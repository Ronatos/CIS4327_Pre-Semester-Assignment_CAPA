# CIS4327_Pre-Semester-Assignment_CAPA
Due: August 22  Develop a portion of administrative features of a typical volunteer management system. In particular, develop functionalities to manage volunteer profile information and manage volunteer opportunities. Work as a team to develop the requested features using selected web development platforms (ASP.NET or PHP or Node/React JS). You are allowed to make necessary assumptions on missing information about the requirements and context of usage of the system. Make decisions as a team to develop these two features. The purpose of this assignment is to test your course pre-requisite skill sets and provide you with an opportunity to practice web programming skills as a team. Mentors will use this assignment to determine your teamâ€™s capability.  You are expected to upload the source code or submit a link to the repository in Canvas and share the same with your mentor.
